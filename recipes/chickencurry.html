        <strong><h3>Description</h3></strong>
        <p>Like most Bangladeshi families we lived in a chaotic big extended family and always
         had large groups over for holiday meals. My mom was the best cook – or most enthusiastic 
         at least – in the family. Bangladeshi mom’s always looked for ways to stretch simple curries 
         to feed a huge tribe. Protein dishes always included one or two vegetables. One of her best comfort food 
         dishes was Murgir Aloo Jhol (Chicken and Potato in Curry Gravy).

        <uL>
            <li>bone-in whole chicken cut into medium sized pieces</li>
            <li>4 large large potatoes cut in half</li>
            <li>1 medium tomato chopped</li>
            <li>3 medium onion thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste can substitute fresh chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste can substitute fresh chopp</li>
            <li>1 bayleaf</li>
            <li>6 whole peppercorn (alt use ½ tablespoon crushed </li>
            <li>2 whole Cloves</li>
            <li>2 Cardamom Pods</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon turmeric (half used to sauce potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Curry Powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pantch puran seed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Cumin Powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam Masala</li>
            <li>4-5 green chillies chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups Water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cilantro chopped</li>
        </uL>

         <ol>
            <li>Heat 4 or 5 tablespoon of oil in a pan. Fry the cut potatoes with ½ tsp of turmeric over medium heat, let them turn golden brown in color, remove and keep aside.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining oil in the same pan to temper the bay leaf, cardamom, peppercorn, cloves, cinnamon, and panch phoran.</li>
            <li>Add sliced onion, fry until light golden brown in color. This step is essential to give a rich color and texture to the gravy.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger and garlic paste, and cook until the raw smell is gone.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining spices: salt, cumin powder, coriander powder, curry powder, chilli powder, garam masala, and tomatoes. Cook over medium heat until the masala starts separating from the oil; this typically takes 10 minutes.
            <li>Add the chicken pieces and green chillies. Cover and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. At this point the chicken will start releasing its juices.</li></li>
            <li>Add in the fried potatoes and cook for 5 minutes on low heat. At this point add in 2 cups of water. I prefer to use boiling hot water. Cook for 10 minutes on low</li> 
            <li>You can check the spice and salt level at this time. You can add more salt or red chilli powder if you want to make the curry spicier.</li>
            <li>Give the curry 5 minutes to rest. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with steamed white rice.</li>
